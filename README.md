 SoundTrax
Crowd-sourced database for identifying music in film. 

  If you've ever been struck by stirring music in film, you know the desire to know the track title and artist.

This application bridges the gap between the moment you hear that certain rhythm or melody, and the collective knowledge of the internet. By connecting movie and music buffs, the your favorites sounds that accompany your favorite films are at your fingertips.
